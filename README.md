## Features

### User created levels

Crafted a system allowing users to design and upload their own levels, which can subsequently be downloaded and played by other gamers.

### 2D Collision with Rectangular Hitboxes

Refined collision detection has been implemented, employing rectangular hitboxes to guarantee precise and responsive interactions between the player and the game environment.

Integrated "Coyote Time," a feature that grants players a brief window to execute a jump after departing from a ledge, enhancing the platforming experience with a touch of forgiveness and enjoyment.
